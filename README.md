# EtherWallet

I tried building an implementation of Ether Wallet ðŸ‘› example from [solidity-by-example]("https://solidity-by-example.org/app/ether-wallet/")
on my own with a few extra features like:
  * Withdraw only a required amount
  * Transfer Ether to someone
 
 Had a lot of fun ðŸ™‚ building it ðŸ› . 
 
 I have also deployed ðŸš€ it on the Ropsten Testnet.
